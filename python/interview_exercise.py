# 1. Pandas data manipulation + analytical problem solving

# 2. Some average two-dimensional array problem

# 3. Coding assessment on coderpad - leetcode easy-medium questions, nothing too complicated

# 4. Program game of Life

# 5. Create a simple string manipulation function in Python

# 6. Write a recursive function in Python

# 7. Create an object class in Python to iterate over sequences.
 
# 8. Opening questions on technical portion were: What is a median? How would you 
# go about calculating a median from a dataset too large to store in memory? 

# 9. Consider the following bit string 11?100
# you need to write a method which can replace this question mark with 1 & 0
# Output should be: 110100 , 111100
# This should be implemented for N number of question mark each time replaced with 1 and then with 0


# 10. Code up and solve a simulation of Conway's game of life
